<DESC><![CDATA[[i]Recognising[/i] the praiseworthy aims of the target to prevent unsustainable hunting practices, as well as to restrict trade of endangered animal meats;

[i]Noting[/i], however, that the resolution&#39;s failure to qualify &quot;hunting&quot; means that it includes the inhumane, cruel practice of trophy hunting, where animal carcasses are simply kept as trophies without any actual use such as consumption as food;

[i]Further noting[/i] that Section 1 of the target grants member nations the right to &quot;allow...the hunting of non-endangered animal stocks&quot;, thus implying that the World Assembly is unable to itself restrict such hunting in any form;

[i]Concerned[/i] that the World Assembly is therefore unable to prohibit or even restrict trophy hunting of non-endangered animals, and especially unconvinced by arguments that it should be permitted, as it necessarily includes the death of wild animals without any benefit beyond the recreation of those who perform the activity;

[i]Cognisant[/i] of other flaws in the wording of the target, including that:
[list][*]Section 5c qualifying the exceptions for antiques, academic use and artwork with regards to the status of the species at the time means that specimens or artwork of historical significance cannot be traded internationally based on a factor which is both retroactive and largely irrelevant for current use; and


[*]The exception in Section 2 for potential disease vectors makes no regard for the status of the species or their importance to an ecosystem, meaning that member nations no longer have any obligation under the clause to protect certain endangered species even in a manner that accommodates for the risk of diseases;[/list]
[i]Concluding[/i], therefore, that these flaws necessitate repeal and replacement with improved legislation to protect the environment and animal welfare;

<DESC><![CDATA[The World Assembly (WA),

Affirming the fundamental right for a sapient individual to freely leave a member state of the WA (&quot;exit state&quot;), at any time, temporarily or permanently, of their own free will and accord;

The WA hereby enacts as follows:

[list=1]
[*][b]Right to exit[/b]. No restrictions can be placed on an individual from leaving an exit state, unless the exit state can conclusively show (with the burden of proof on that exit state) that the particular individual:
[list=a]
[*]is deemed legally incompetent in the exit state, and, under the laws of the exit state, has not been permitted to leave the exit state by the legal parent(s) or guardian(s) of the individual; or
[*]has been granted bail pending trial in the exit state for a serious criminal offence, and (i) that bail is granted on condition of that inhabitant staying in the exit state, and (ii) that the inhabitant has exhausted all avenues of appeal (or voluntarily waived appeals) against the said bail conditions; or
[*]has failed to respond to a duly issued arrest warrant for a serious criminal offence in the exit state; or
[*]has been duly convicted of a serious criminal offence, and the sentencing tariff (or other conditions such as parole conditions) require that the individual seeks approval from a competent authority of that WA state prior to traveling or exiting that state.[/list]

[*][b]Appeals to restrictions[/b]. A WA state is required to, subject to due process of law applicable to that WA state:
[list=a]
[*]inform the individual if they are restricted from travel, and provide channels for appeals on such restrictions;
[*]review the restrictions in sub-clause (2)(d) from time to time, and ensure that they are only in place for as long necessary;
[*]consider any humanitarian requests for temporary exits, such as to attend funerals. [/list]

[*][b]No retribution[/b].
[list=a]
[*]If someone leaves the WA state in violation of clause (1), no WA state may impose retribution on anyone related to that individual, such as relatives, friends, or associates, specifically for the said violation.
[*]This resolution does not govern offences under other applicable laws, such as a prison warden charged with abetting a jailbreak that results in a violation of clause 1.[/list]

[*][b]Exclusions[/b]. This resolution does not govern:
[list=a]
[*]exits if the WA state is at a state of war (either declared by the WA state or deemed as such by WA organs);
[*]conditions of exit related to national security (including national service);
[*]exits by employees or representatives of the WA or WA organs acting in an official capacity;
[*]transfers of prisoners between WA states where the prisoner(s) transferred continue to serve their sentences;
[*]anyone duly subject to a quarantine;
[*]anyone subject to limited emergency civilian service;
[*]any other conditions imposed by the WA.[/list][/list]]]></DESC>

<DESC><![CDATA[The World Assembly (WA),

Appreciative of the aim of GA#693 to eradicate forced blood sports, which many delegations consider to be a blight redolent of brutal gladiatorial combat and similarly repulsive, brutal spectacle;

Frustrated with the definition of &#147;forced blood sport&#148;, which is restricted only to activities &#147;intended to entertain&#148;, forcing WA delegations to discern the intent of participants without any meaningful impact on the activities associated with blood sports or the scope for injuries and death on the part of participants, sapient or otherwise;

Distressed that, for sapient individuals, both the protection against forced participation in such activities and the prohibition against the trafficking of individuals for such purposes are already largely covered by GA#23;

At the same time, acknowledging the inherent difficulty of regulating this issue in the presence of GA#267, which gives certain exemptions to certain circumstances such as threats to ecosystems from invasive non-sapient species, as well as catering to some WA members that may rely on hunting animals for food as their primary source of food;

Frustrated that the result is that the target resolution provides a blanket exemption for &#147;hunting for sapient consumption shall not be considered a forced blood sport for the purpose of this resolution&#148;, thus allowing some member states to bring themselves into compliance by holding a barbecue at the end of every hunting event, assuming the hunted species is edible, regardless of whether entertainment or competitive aspects are in place, and defeating much of the purpose of the target resolution in the first place;

Hereby Repeals GA#693 &#147;Forced Blood Sport Eradication Act&#148;.]]></DESC>

Believing self defense to be an essential human (or otherwise) right to ensure safety and peace of mind,

Hereby enacts the following in all member nations:

[list=1][*]Every person shall have the inalienable right to protect themselves, other people, and property from violence, destruction, and theft given that the force used for defense is not excessive.
[*]For the purposes of this resolution;
[list=a][*]&quot;violence&quot; shall refer only to physical harm done from one person to another, and
[*]&quot;attack&quot; shall mean a person initiating (or attempting to initiate) violence with another without having been provoked by violence or the actual threat of such violence by the individual(s) they have harmed.[/list]
[*]If a person, other people, or someone&#39;s property are put at an imminent threat of harm or theft due to another person&#39;s active attack or attempt of theft, force no less than what is necessary to stop the incoming attack or theft must be permitted in response, provided that such response is proportional to the actual threat.
[*]Nothing in section 3 shall apply to any action taken against a law enforcement official lawfully conducting their duties.
[*]No person shall face any civil or criminal penalty as a result of any of the actions protected by section 3, provided that no physical damage is inflicted on any party other than the one guilty of the original attack. Any such physical damage to bystanders may still be punished by law where such damage could have been avoided while still acting in self-defense.
[*]If a person commits an action in which they mistakenly believe they would be protected by section 3, the reasons for their mistake including real-time context, the person&#39;s mental capacity, any prior history between the relevant parties, and any other factors deemed relevant in a court of law shall be considered. If a person can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that;
[list][*]the actual danger in question was obscured as a direct result of actions taken by the original aggressor,
[*]the person acting in defense of themselves or others could not have known or reasonably have been expected to know that the perceived threat was not as serious as it had been perceived to be, and
[*]the response to the perceived level of threat would have been protected by section 3 had the perception of danger been accurate,[/list]
the person shall face no civil or criminal penalty as a result of the actions they took in response to the perceived danger.
[*]be it clarified that nothing in this resolution shall prevent any member state from expanding and strengthening the availability of self-defense.[/list]]]></DESC>

<DESC><![CDATA[The World Assembly (WA),

Condemning in the strongest possible terms the use of civilian airplanes as weapons of destruction, or other grotesque acts such as hijackings and deliberate destruction of aircraft;

Desiring a common protocol among WA states to criminalize such acts, especially when such acts involve multiple states;

The WA hereby enacts as follows:

[list=1]
[*][b]Definitions[/b].
[list=1]
[*]&quot;Aircraft&quot; means anything defined by WA organs as being able to travel in airspace relying on its own power, excluding any living flying creatures.
[*]&quot;Aircraft&quot; excludes flying object used for a non-civilian purpose as defined by national laws or extant WA resolutions. &quot;Non-civilian&quot; includes the use of aircraft designed for civilian use for non-civilian purposes.
[*]An aircraft is deemed &#147;in service&#148; from the start of the preflight preparation of the aircraft for flight until all of the passengers, crew and cargo have disembarked from the aircraft, including the time spent in flight.
[*]&quot;Airport&quot;, for convenience, includes not just aerodromes but also heliports, spaceports, seaports serving flying boats, and similar facilities. &quot;Airport&quot; excludes any facilities used for purely non-civilian purposes but includes dual-use facilities.
[*]&quot;WA organs&quot; means any of the committees of the WA.
[*]&quot;WAJC&quot; means the WA Judiciary Committee.[/list]

[*][b]Destruction[/b]. An individual who deliberately performs any of the following acts commits an offence:
[list=a]
[*]Destroying an aircraft in service; or
[*]Using an aircraft in service to cause death, bodily injury, or causing any significant damage to physical property or the environment;
[*]An act of force to attempt to or seize or otherwise take control of an aircraft in service; or
[*]Mutiny by any crew members in an aircraft in service.[/list]

[*][b]Threats to safety[/b]. An individual who deliberately performs any of the following acts commits an offence, if that act is deemed likely to compromise the safety of that aircraft in service:
[list=a]
[*]An act of violence against anyone onboard an aircraft;
[*]An act of causing damage to an aircraft, or any of the equipment inside an aircraft;
[*]An act of communicating critical information that the individual knows to be materially false to anyone who has a duty to ensure the safety of any aircraft, such as to airport staff, pilots, and air traffic controllers;
[*]An act of causing damage to any equipment serving international aircraft traffic, such as navigation systems on the ground or any airport facilities; or
[*]An act of causing significant disruptions to the operations of an airport.[/list]

[*][b]Aiding and abetting[/b].
[list=a]
[*]An individual who deliberately aids, abets, induces, or counsels any other individual to commit any of the acts stated in clauses (2) and (3) commits an offence.
[*]An individual who deliberately threatens to commit any of the acts stated in clauses (2) and (3) in a manner that can be interpreted by a reasonable person as making a credible threat commits an offence.[/list]

[*][b]Mitigating factors[/b].
[list=a]
[*]Self-defense is a valid defense for anyone charged with an offence under clauses (2), (3) and (4).
[*]An individual misled into committing such acts is a mitigating factor for an offence under clauses (3) and (4).
[*]Inebriation, drug-induced effects, or a lack of mental capacity are mitigating factors for an offence under clauses (3) and (4).
[*]The lack of capability to carry out the said threats is not a mitigating factor for an offence under sub-clause (4)(b).[/list]

[*][b]Scope of jurisdiction.[/b] A WA state may assert jurisdiction on any of the acts committed under clauses (2) to (4) if:
[list=a]
[*]A WA state is the flag state of the aircraft; or
[*]The act occurred within the airspace of the said WA state; or
[*]The act damaged the property or the environment of a WA state; or
[*]The act killed, injured, or harmed an individual who is subject to the jurisdiction of the WA, WA organs or that WA state.[/list]

[*][b]Jurisdiction[/b].
[list=a]
[*]All WA states are required to criminalize all of the offences stated in this resolution.
[*]The principle of [i]aut dedere aut judicare[/i] applies to anyone who commits an offence under clauses (2) to (4).
[*]This resolution does not govern (i) any conduct during wartime, whether such war is declared or otherwise; or (ii) any criminal charges derived from national laws.[/list]

[*][b]WAJC roles[/b]. The WAJC shall have jurisdiction on:
[list=a]
[*]any disputes over jurisdiction between WA states (or between WA states vs the WA); or
[*]any acts committed against aircraft under the flag of the WA; or
[*]any acts for which a non-WA state has voluntarily abandoned assertion of jurisdiction.[/list][/list]]]></DESC>

Proud that the Member-States of this assembly are composed of myriad diverse cultures and forms of life,

Aspiring to empower Member-States to encounter, create, and cooperate with new forms of life, regardless of technological development or differences in physiology and psychology, wherever and however they may be found,

And convinced that a universal, coherent, and comprehensive policy regarding the possibility of sapience of any given lifeform, and methodology for determining such, will minimize the harms caused by uncertainty and empower Member-States to embrace new forms of life,

Hereby;

Defines, for the purposes of this resolution: [list=1][*]&#39;Lifeform&#39; as; any detectable and coherent entity which exhibits clear internal signalling, homeostatic, and organizational processes, or which exhibits clear internal processes functionally indistinguishable from such relative to its composition or state of existence,
[*]&#39;Substantially Similar&#39;, excepting where used in this definition, as; any lifeform which shares substantial similarity to another lifeform such that they could be reasonably assumed to be individuals of the same design or species,
[*]&#39;Xenoinvestigative Body&#39; as; any governmental organization comprising of qualified experts in fields relevant to social, psychological, historical, and evolutionary development, operated with the express and specific purposes of identifying potential Sapient Lifeforms and making determinations with regards to such status as defined within this resolution,
[*]&#39;Technology&#39; as; any tool, device, construction, or program, manufactured by a lifeform, for the purpose of performing or assisting in the performance of a task, or for the purpose of producing another tool, device or construction, regardless of material, medium, or design complexity,
[*]&#39;Communication&#39; as; any means, regardless of mode or apparent complexity, with which a lifeform expresses complex ideas and meaning, to any other lifeform, whether or not it is Substantially Similar, capable of receiving and understanding the expression,
[*]&#39;General Reasoning&#39; as; the ability of a given lifeform to exhibit generally complex reasoning and both logical and illogical &#150; but internally sound - decision making within a variety of distinct conditions and environments both within and without its observed or known range of experience,
[*]&#39;Sapient Lifeform&#39; as; any lifeform which exhibits the ability to produce Technologies, Communicate, and Generally Reason, as determined by a Xenoinvestigative Body of a Member-State, or a similar non-Member-State entity,[/list]
Mandates: [list=1][*]That all Member-States lacking a Xenoinvestigative Body establish such at the earliest practicable opportunity, or otherwise designate, with mutual agreement, a Xenoinvestigative Body operated by another Member-State for the purpose, and confer upon it all authority and access needed to perform its assigned purpose,
[*]That Member-States, upon identifying a potential Sapient Lifeform, as soon as practicable, and as appropriate:[list=a][*]Begin investigation via, at minimum, the most relevant Member-State&#146;s Xenoinvestigative body, per the established standards regarding Sapient Lifeforms,
[*]Declare, based on clear and obvious factors, such as widespread use of highly complex technologies, or other relevant and immediately apparent factors, a Lifeform to be a Sapient Lifeform without formal investigation, or the formal completion of investigation,[/list]
[*]That investigations into the sapience of a species by Xenoinvestigative Bodies: [list=a][*]Consist, at the first phase, of robust and thorough investigative research to determine all reasonably accessible factors relevant to the investigation,
[*]That all determinations regarding Technology, Communication, and General Reasoning take place in terms reasonable and relevant to the Lifeform undergoing investigation, and that all effort be made to accommodate and account for relevant distinctions that would otherwise threaten accurate determinations,[/list]
[*]That Member-States treat any and all lifeforms undergoing investigation regarding their status as a Sapient Lifeform with the full dignity and respect conferred to confirmed Sapient Lifeforms, and all practicable national and international legal and ethical protections extended to such,
[*]That Member-States consider all lifeforms which are Substantially Similar to a known Sapient Lifeform, as being themselves Sapient Lifeforms, regardless of individual ability to meet the defined standard therein or any disabilities or impairments,
[*]That Member-States consider any and all Sapient Lifeforms identified or declared by another Member-State, to be Sapient Lifeforms under their own law,
[*]That, with regards to all national and international law binding upon or within Member-States, all identified Sapient Lifeforms are to be considered persons, and afforded all rights, privileges, protections, restrictions, and duties thereof.[/list]]]></DESC>

<DESC><![CDATA[The Security Council,

Turning the page to elden days, an age where chaos and destruction knew no bounds nor end, snuffing out the lights of civilizations and worlds in an ever-darkening night,

Beholding the rise of Nasicournia, a congregation of vibrant nations first bound together by their collective histories, a series of interwoven partnerships and conflicts connecting the first dozen and eventually hundreds of Nasicournian nations together into what would become not only one of the most developed regions in the world, but one of the first vibrant and multivarious communities. Nasicournia would house nations from other foundling allies like A New Begining and Cannabis Island to early raiders who, despite their eventual ideological dissonance with Nasicournia, would find a home united under Nasicournia&#146;s collective stories, chronicling their many histories together &#151; the most extensive of which include:[list]
[*]the aftermath of the release of a Katangarian dead-hand system, resulting in a series of conflicts between some of the greatest military powers in Nasicournia over possession of the superweapon,
[*]the mystical tale of feudal warlords and their samurai servants across Nasicournia, battling one another in the name of honor and greed,
[*]the intergalactic adventures of a pirate crew walking in the footsteps of pirate legend Lawrence Spacecreed, as space-faring militaries attempt to capture them in a journey through the stars,[/list]

Disheartened that while Nasicournia would transform under this collaborative premise, creating a regional identity and government that would see it flourish, its shining light would also draw the attention of malevolent forces both within and beyond Nasicournia&#146;s borders, resulting in repeated attacks on the region upon the disappearance of founder Nasicournus,

Amazed, however, at the collective response of the community, which vigorously repelled numerous attacks with the help of their allies. They would go on to develop the unique strategy of establishing a border region known as the Nasicournian Borderlands to protect the homeland, an effort mirrored in success only by fellow antiquity region Hell, and eventually did the unthinkable, swaying the powers above to grant the insuperable powers of foundership to Pope Hope, the architect of the region&#146;s rise,

Further awed that these constant assaults did not dissuade Nasicournia from the threats beyond its walls, rather inspiring its members to step up and take a defiant stand against invaders. Nasicournia would go on to help found the legendary Alliance Defense Network (ADN), which would go on to defend innumerable regions from attack and combat despotism and destruction at the hands of regimes like the New Pacific Order, which Nasicournia helped lead the opposition against in its earliest years,

Appreciating Nasicournia&#146;s key role not only in developing the ADN&#146;s framework, ranks, and leadership with its dozens of bright, passionate defenders, but also its identity and purpose. Nasicournia would serve as a hub for many of its members in between battles, where they would often join Nasicournians in their domestic events and efforts, and acted as a reminder of what the ADN was striving to protect &#151; vulnerable, vibrant communities &#151; many of whom like the North Pacific, Juxtaposition X, or Equilism, joined the ADN as a product of Nasicournian outreach and connections,

Astounded at Nasicournia&#146;s incredible dedication to the practice of defending, being key in the birth of the cornerstone defender institutions of intelligence and operationality that continue to play a key role in defending  to this day, exemplified by their regional defender apparatuses including:[list]
[*]the renowned defender army Nasicorps, led by fabled defenders like Pope Hope and Goobergunchia, who would be an ever-present force fighting on the front lines in early battles in regions like United States and Middle Earth. The Nasicorps would also act as a critical force within the ADN and other foundational defender alliances like the Allied Liberation League, particularly in operations of legend like the battles of the North Pacific against Pixiedance, and
[*]the historical hallmark of defender intelligence known as the Nasicournian Intelligence Agency (NIA), which itself purveyed NationStates in the early years and was critical in the early protection of countless regions. The NIA acted as a crucial and oft-underappreciated information source in a time where information was quickly lost and raider organizations and operations were manifold, allowing invasions to go undetected long after the target was seized,[/list]

Enshrining the tales of those who grew bright in the underwood of this dark forest, the stories of their endurance lighting the trail for those of us who have since gone on into a brighter day,

Hereby Commends Nasicournia.]]></DESC>

<DESC><![CDATA[The World Assembly (WA),

Affirming the WA&#146;s efforts to protect those needing temporary mental and health support,

Noting that a temporary guardian may be occasionally imposed on an individual with severe temporary mental illness (against the will of the said individual);

Believing that imposing a conservator is highly intrusive and should only be done if strictly necessary;

The WA hereby enacts as follows:

[list=1]
[*][b]Definitions[/b].
[list=a]
[*]&quot;Authority&quot; means a competent authority in charge of interpreting and enforcing this resolution in a WA state.
[*]&quot;Conservatorship&quot; means a mandate imposed on an individual suffering from severe temporary mental illness (&#147;conservatee&#148;) by the authority, in order to allow another individual (&#147;conservator&#148;) to manage the affairs of the conservatee on a temporary basis.
[*]&quot;MHS&quot; means a mental health specialist qualified according to the laws of that WA state.[/list]

[*][b]Scope[/b]. This resolution governs only conservatorships imposed on a conservatee due to the individual being deemed by at least three MHSs to be:
[list=a]
[*]temporarily mentally incompetent due to mental illness or mental disorder, and
[*]imposed under the direction of the authority, and
[*]only when it is expressly against the will of the conservatee.[/list]

[*][b]Exclusions[/b]. This resolution does not govern any guardianship imposed where the individual:
[list=a]
[*]has explicitly affirmatively consented to the guardianship;
[*]has not yet reached the age of majority in that WA state;
[*]has been conclusively demonstrated to suffer from irreversible cases of dementia, major cognitive impairment, intellectual disability at birth, or acquired brain damage due to accident or illness.[/list]

[*][b]Duty of care[/b].
[list=a]
[*]A conservator has a fiduciary duty and a non-delegable duty of care to a conservatee.
[*]A conservator commits a criminal offence if they are found to have been derelict in their duties.
[*]A conservator can be a family member of the conservatee, or a professional guardian.
[*]A conservator can only be appointed by the authority.
[*]Fees for the conservator shall be paid for by the authority and not by the conservatee.[/list]

[*][b]Qualifications[/b]. Anyone who acts as a conservator shall:
[list=a]
[*]Be at or above the age of majority in that WA state;
[*]Be capable of taking care of the conservatee;
[*]Be capable of actively promoting and protecting the interests of the welfare of the conservatee, in areas such as housing, food supply, medical care as well as in education, employment or in general care;
[*]Be free of any undue conflicts of interests with the conservatee, especially of a financial nature;
[*]Be willing and able to promote the conservatee&#146;s interests ahead of the conservator&#146;s own interests.[/list]

[*][b]Finances[/b].
[list=a]
[*]The authority shall determine if a conservator shall manage the finances of a conservatee as a trustee directly, or if a separate trustee is required, depending on the wealth of the conservatee.
[*]Any trustee managing a conservatee&#146;s finances shall aim for full preservation of capital, subject to supervision by the authority.[/list]

[*][b]Conservator[/b]. A conservator can only be imposed by an authority on an individual as conservatee, subject to due process, if it deems that the individual:
[list=a]
[*]has a fully diagnosed temporary mental illness (as testified by at least two MHSs) of sufficient degree to warrant imposing conservatorship;
[*]is incapable of making reasonable decisions on their own circumstances, and
[*]the affairs of the individual can only be managed by a conservator and that no other less restrictive means are available.[/list]

[*][b]Regular review[/b].
[list=a]
[*]Each authority must regularly review the need for conservatorship, based on the latest evaluation of the conditions of the conservatee as determined by at least two MHS.
[*]Each authority must also consider any review requests or appeals from a conservatee. No conservator may impede the ability of a conservatee to request for a review.
[*]The MHS appointed by an authority for each review shall be different from the MHS appointed at the time conservatorship is imposed, and different MHS shall be used for each subsequent review.[/list]

[*][b]Recognition and appeals[/b].
[list=a]
[*]No one who is (or was) employed by the WA or any of the committees or as a representative of a WA state to the WA may be placed under conservatorship.
[*]No WA state may grant recognition of a conservatorship granted by another WA state without a separate independent process.
[*]If a conservatee exhausts the appeals processes of that WA state, they may directly appeal to the Judiciary Committee on a de novo basis.[/list][/list]]]></DESC>

<DESC><![CDATA[The Security Council,

Noting that Security Council Resolution #503, which commended Writinglegend (also known as Gleg), was based on activities and achievements that are now largely outdated and insignificant to the contemporary NationStates community;

Observing that the nation Writinglegend has not demonstrated significant activity or leadership in recent years, rendering their past contributions less relevant to the current state of international affairs;

Highlighting that the legacy of Writinglegend is relatively unknown to the majority of the NationStates community today, which diminishes the impact and recognition of their supposed contributions;

Criticizing the original resolution for emphasizing events and accomplishments that lack verifiable and compelling evidence of lasting influence or benefit to the broader community, including:

Their early ministerial work in Europeia, such as organizing a Summerfest in space and a Winter Ball, events which have little lasting impact or recognition in the current context of regional politics and culture.

Leading the Europeian Republican Navy (ERN) in wargames and antifascist operations, which, despite being notable at the time, do not have a lasting legacy or substantial impact on current geopolitical dynamics.

Their involvement in the creation of the Ministries of Radio and World Assembly Affairs (WAA), and the establishment of the Media Development and Distribution Agreement, which are largely administrative achievements that have not shown enduring significance.

Overseeing a Constitutional Convention in 2018, an event that, while important for Europeia, does not resonate broadly across the wider NationStates community today.
Pointing out that many of Writinglegend&#39;s actions only marginally benefited Europeia and often added layers of bureaucratic complexity without significantly improving the region, thereby limiting the broader impact of their efforts;

Arguing that commendations should be reserved for individuals or nations whose actions have a clear and enduring positive impact on the international community, which is not sufficiently demonstrated in the case of Writinglegend;

Believing that the Security Council&#39;s commendations should reflect the current values and standards of excellence in the international community, and should be based on achievements that are widely recognized and respected;

<DESC><![CDATA[World Assembly,

RECOGNISING the significance of free trade, current international regulations, national jurisdiction at sea, and World
Assembly&#39;s effort in regulating significant international legislation we present;

[b]International Waters Regulation Convention (IWRC):[/b]

[b]Article 1: Purpose of the Convention[/b]

The convention&#39;s purpose is to regulate international waters in a more centralized way. This is important because it creates a legal instrument for each member nation and a standardized framework for organizations and corporations operating in international waters.

[b]Article 2: Water zones[/b]
1) INTERNAL WATERS: Any waters that are inside a state&#39;s territory that are not connected to the main sea
2) TERRITORIAL WATERS: Sea region max 12 M from the shore/baseline.
3) CONTIGUOUS ZONE: Sea region starting from borders of territorial waters up to 24 M from the shore/baseline
4) EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE: Sea region up to 200 M from the shore/baseline
5) HIGH SEAS: The international sea waters behind EEZ

[b]Article 3: Jurisdiction and regulation of water zones[/b]
1) INTERNAL WATERS:
Internal waters are inside the state territory without contact with the major sea, therefore the nation has full jurisdiction and
governance over the zone. Internal waters are not subject to the convention regulations

2) TERRITORIAL WATERS:
Territorial waters are a zone within a state&#39;s borders. Thereforea state has full jurisdiction over the zone and national laws apply. Therefore all military, security, border control, and migration prevention activities are legal in the subject state. The national and international military activities if an official invitation is present are not of international concern.

The convention&#39;s rules about the passage of civilian vessels and vessels that do not pose a threat to the subject state are
applicable, therefore the free passage of watercraft to the harbor and rescue services shall be granted if the state vessel is
registered in a state that is currently not in conflict with subject state or the territorial waters must be passed for access to
vessel&#39;s destination locations and no alternative routes are possible. No free passage to military watercraft of other states.

3) CONTIGUOUS ZONE:
The contiguous zone is under full jurisdiction of the subject state, and most of the regulations for territorial waters apply, but the zone is outside the borderline of the state. Therefore free passage of vessels that should not approach the subject state&#39;s territorial waters must be granted, with exclusion for military vessels. The subject state has the right to execute legal activities including punishment if a vessel breaks the state&#39;s laws inside the territorial waters but left to the contiguous zone

No other state has rights to economic activity, mining, destroying continental shelf, archeological expeditions, or fishing
within this zone. National legislation applies to such activities. The state has the right to execute legal procedures towards actors doing such activities in the zone.

4) EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE
Exclusive economic zone is an extension to zones added to create fair economic possibilities for the member states. The state has only economic and excavation jurisdiction over the zone, meaning that the state has full control over the seabed, mining, excavation, resource gathering, and trade jurisdiction. The national laws applied are only those that are within the scope of jurisdiction. All convention chapters, except those that are under the jurisdiction of the state, are applied.

5) HIGH SEAS
The international waters are fully governed by the convention. No further explanation is needed.

[b]Article 4: Free passage of vessels in international waters[/b]
Free passage of all vessels must be granted within high seas regardless of the vessel&#39;s status, this governs both civilian and military vessels. No state has the right to somehow interfere with the ships passing through high seas.

[b]Article 5: Mining and resource gathering in international waters[/b]
All mining and resource-gathering activities are allowed on the high seas, concerning international legislation e.g. environmental and trade legislation.

[b]Article 6: Free trade in international waters[/b]
All trade activities are permitted on high seas, according to the active international legislation. No piracy is allowed, nor any customs payments nor any tax collection.

[b]Article 7: Creation of the International Sea Monitoring Committee and its duties[/b]
To monitor the activities on the high seas and activities of the states in the defined zones, hereby CISMC is created. The committee is a nongovernmental and nonpolitical international organization monitoring the appliance of the convention. The duties of the committee are:

1) Convention appliance monitoring
2) Assistance to states for policy compliance
3) Assistance to applicable governmental institutions during the transition period after the convention becomes active
4) Organising expert forums and information exchange between states and regions.]]></DESC>

<DESC><![CDATA[Recognizing the intent that the Resolution has, but concerned about the potential impact that un-restricted reporting from warzones could have on military campaigns and national security, such as:

1. If a nation implements Martial Law, which is common during wartime, many laws and statutes (i.e. freedom of speech) may be temporarily suspended or restricted, which would be in direct conflict with the aforementioned resolution;

2. If journalists are given relatively unrestricted access, it could harm the secrecy of covert operations, and therefore put the lives of soldiers and potentially civilians at risk;

3. Journalists are within the rights given to them by the aforementioned resolution to, among other things: a. Report on military strategy, which should remain secret, b. Willfully distort the truth or blatantly lie in their reporting, which may cause many unforeseen circumstances regarding a conflict, c. Their presence may force militaries to alter or halt operations to protect the journalists&#39; safety, which may harm the orders they are to carry out etc.;

While recognizing the importance of independent journalism in wartime, and therefore eager to revise the aforementioned resolution to fix its flaws.]]></DESC>
